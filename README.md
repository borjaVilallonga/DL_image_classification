# DL_image_classification
Deep Learning project applied to CIFAR-10. CNNs and Transformers are implemented, with data augmentation, transfer learning, and GANs techniques. ResNet, ViT, and MobileNetV2 achieve the best performance. The work combines experimentation, critical analysis, and practical learning in computer vision.
